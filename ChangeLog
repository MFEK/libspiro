    * Libspiro Version 20190731
    * Corrected library to report correctly as next version up. This is
      probably a significant change, therefore bumped library to start
      at 1.0 even though backwards compatibility remains close to same.
    * Scaling bug fixed. Libspiro can accept points that can be shifted
      and/or scaled, this gives libspiro more flexiblity with graphics
      and templates. Large or small spiros created before this fix may
      need adjusting to fit the new calculations, but they're resizable
      and movable afterwards.
    * Added toggle switch ncq giving users additional functionality not
      easily accessible through spiro paths, including quad0 access.
    * Removed the excessively long package name, which you'll note as a
      so-bump change with Fedora and also Debian in naming this package.
    * Some Java alignment fixed - Thanks to Mingye Wang
    * Added new anchor and handle {'a','h'} which may be useful to many.
    * Fix System.arraycopy and README.md - Thanks to Wieslaw Soltes.
    * Include config header before DO_TIME_DAY - Thanks to Jeremy Tan.

    * Libspiro Version 0.4.20150701
    * Re-edit lib and tests to be more accommodating of older compilers.
    * Many changes to call-test.c to run on bigger variety of platforms,
      and some minor configure.ac tweaks done to resolve issues #9, #10.
      as seen on https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro/issues and:
	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=789012
    * Added developer/install test for cyclic spiros (without {} or z).
    * Verify libspiro output data is correct for test curves {0,1,2,4}.
    * User can overide default configure flags with LS_CFLAGS and LS_LIB

    * Libspiro Version 0.3.20150131
    * Allow Libspiro to be included using PKG_CHECK_MODULES().
    * Bug fixes in configure.ac m4 calls that caused problems seen in:
	https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=196780
	https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/43373
    * Add TaggedSpiroCPsToBezier1() and SpiroCPsToBezier1() for programs
      that cannot use TaggedSpiroCPsToBezier0() or SpiroCPsToBezier0().

    * Libspiro Version 0.2.20130930
    * Optional 'make check' runs 'call-test' to check libspiro functions.
    * Minor logic optimizations. Removed global 'n', passed 'n' instead.

    * Use 'make check' to run spiro.c UNIT_TEST internal main() routine.

- 2013-Jun-28
    * Allow for setting VERBOSE during configure - helps with debugging.
    * Allow for setting CHECK_INPUT_FINITENESS during configure - to test
      input values for finiteness before doing calculations (optional).
    * Pass nmat variable to reduce repeatedly recomputing with count_vec().

- 2013-May-31
    * Convert build system to autotools method (configure.ac, Makefile.am).
    * Backporting robustness patches from Inkscape.
    * Increase Spiro max iterations to 30 after finding convergences of 15.
    * If did not converge or encountered non-finite values, do not output
      spline. Only good splines will be output.
